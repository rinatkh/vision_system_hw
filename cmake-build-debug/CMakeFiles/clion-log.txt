-- Standard libraries to link to explicitly: none
-- The Fortran compiler identification is GNU 9.4.0
-- Found unsuitable Qt version "5.12.8" from /usr/bin/qmake
-- Qt4 not found, so disabling the mandelbrot and opengl demos
-- Could NOT find CLANG_FORMAT: Found unsuitable version "0.0", but required is exact version "9" (found CLANG_FORMAT_EXECUTABLE-NOTFOUND)
-- Could NOT find CHOLMOD (missing: CHOLMOD_INCLUDES CHOLMOD_LIBRARIES) 
-- Could NOT find UMFPACK (missing: UMFPACK_INCLUDES UMFPACK_LIBRARIES) 
-- Could NOT find KLU (missing: KLU_INCLUDES KLU_LIBRARIES) 
-- Could NOT find SuperLU (missing: SUPERLU_INCLUDES SUPERLU_LIBRARIES SUPERLU_VERSION_OK) (Required is at least version "4.0")
-- A version of Pastix has been found but pastix_nompi.h does not exist in the include directory. Because Eigen tests require a version without MPI, we disable the Pastix backend.
